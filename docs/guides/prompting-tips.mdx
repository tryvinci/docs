Effective prompts improve quality and consistency.

## General guidance
- Be specific and descriptive
- Include movement, lighting, and style cues
- Avoid contradictory instructions
- Keep prompts under ~200 characters for best results

## Examples
- "A cinematic close-up of a hummingbird drinking nectar, golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, smooth slow-motion"
- "Futuristic city skyline at night with neon lights, gentle camera pan, light rain, cyberpunk style"

Info
When using Image-to-Video, describe the intended motion relative to the source image, e.g., "subtle head turn and a friendly smile."

## Performance tips
- Poll status every 5â€“10 seconds
- Use exponential backoff for failures
- Cache final video URLs for reuse
- Prefer webhooks for production (see Webhooks guide)
