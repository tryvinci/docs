## Workflow

<Steps>
### Upload and detect
Upload your video. Let the system auto‑detect language or set it explicitly.

### Choose target
Pick the target language. Select a voice that matches your brand or speaker.

### Generate
Start translation. Speech is transcribed, translated, re‑synthesized, and lip‑synced.

### Review and export
Preview the output, toggle subtitles, then download or share.
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Use videos with clear speech and minimal background noise
- Keep the original pace; avoid highly overlapped speech
- For brand consistency, reuse the same target voice across translations

## Cost and usage

- Standard video pricing per generated second
- Track usage and balance at /docs/guides/billing-usage

## Coming Soon

- More languages and regional variants
- Voice style controls and prosody tuning
