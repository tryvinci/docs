## Best practices

- Match aspect ratio to destination (e.g., 9:16 for Shorts/Reels; 16:9 for YouTube)
- Keep prompts concise and specific: motion, subject, camera, lighting
- Use shorter durations for experiments; scale up after you’re happy

## Cost and usage

- Charged per generated second (see [Pricing](/essentials/pricing))
- See [Billing & Usage](/docs/guides/billing-usage) to monitor spend and balance
