<div>

### Output

</div>
</Columns>

## Workflow

<Steps>
### Write a prompt
Be specific about subject, style, lighting, and composition.

### Tune parameters
Use defaults first. Increase steps for quality; adjust CFG for prompt adherence.

### Generate
Start generation, then review. Re‑roll with a new seed if needed.

### Export or iterate
Download the result or refine your prompt and generate variations.
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Keep prompts under ~200 characters for predictable results
- Use high-level style tags plus concrete details (camera, lighting)
- Prefer PNG when preserving transparency; JPEG for smaller filesize
- Pick aspect ratio templates that match your publishing channel
