# Image-to-Image Prompting Guide

<Tip>
Maximum prompt token is 512 tokens.
</Tip>

## Overview
This guide consolidates best practices for editing images using Kontext-style image-to-image workflows.

<Info>
For fundamental prompting principles that apply to all Vinci services, see the [Prompting Tips](/docs/guides/prompting/prompting-tips) guide.
</Info>

## Basic Object Modifications
Kontext is effective for straightforward object modifications such as recolors, replacing objects, or minor retouching.

Example prompt:
"Change the color of the yellow car to deep cherry red while preserving reflections and highlights."

## Prompt Precision: From Basic to Comprehensive

<Tip>
Be explicit when you need precise control; concise prompts can sometimes change unintended aspects.
</Tip>

### Quick Edits
Simple prompts can work but may alter style or composition.

Prompt example:
"Change to daytime"

[Placeholder image: Input image for quick edit]
[Placeholder image: Output 1]
[Placeholder image: Output 2]

### Controlled Edits
Add preservation instructions to keep style and composition similar to the input.

Prompt example:
"Change to daytime while maintaining the same style of the painting"

[Placeholder image: Input image for controlled edit]

### Complex Transformations
For multiple simultaneous changes include clear, ordered instructions and prioritize the most important changes.

Prompt example:
"Change the setting to daytime, add several people walking on the sidewalk, keep the original painting style and composition"

## Style Transfer
Use direct style names, artist references, and descriptive characteristics.

### Using textual style prompts
1. Name the specific style (e.g., "Bauhaus", "watercolor", "film noir")
2. Reference artists or movements when appropriate
3. Describe key characteristics: brushstrokes, color palette, texture
4. Preserve composition if needed: "keep original composition and object placement"

[Placeholder image: Output — pencil sketch]
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Transformed to oil painting">
[Placeholder image: Output — oil painting]
</Frame>
</Columns>

### Using an input image as a style reference
Provide the style image as a reference and then describe the content you want in that style.

Prompt example:
"Using this style reference image, create a scene where a bunny, a dog, and a cat are having a tea party around a small white table."

## Iterative editing & character consistency
Kontext preserves character identity well when prompts explicitly request preservation.

Framework to maintain character consistency:
- Establish the reference: "The woman with short black hair and a mole on her left cheek..."
- Specify the transformation: environment, activity, or style
- Preserve identity markers: "maintain the same facial features, hairstyle and expression"

Example prompts in editing sequences:
1) "Remove the sunglasses from the woman's face while keeping expression unchanged"
2) "Place the same woman in a snowy street while preserving facial features and pose"

## Text Editing in images
Use quotation marks around exact text you want to change.

Prompt structure:
Replace '[original text]' with '[new text]'

Example:
"Replace 'Choose joy' with 'Choose BFL' while maintaining original font, color and size"

[Placeholder image: Sign with text 'Choose joy']
[Placeholder image: Sign changed to 'Choose BFL']

Best practices for text edits:
- Use exact punctuation and casing
- Ask to preserve font, color, size, and layout when necessary
- Keep replacement text similar in length to avoid layout issues

## Visual cues & masks
Use visual markers, masks, or bounding descriptions to indicate where edits should occur.

Example:
"Add hats inside the three boxes drawn on the upper right quadrant"

[Placeholder image: Input with boxes]
[Placeholder image: Output with hats added]

## Troubleshooting: When results don't match expectations

- If the model changes parts you wanted preserved, explicitly state what should remain unchanged: "Keep everything else in the image identical"
- For character identity drift, enforce identity markers: "preserve exact facial features, hairstyle, eye color"
- If composition shifts unintentionally, state: "Keep the subject in the exact same position, scale, and pose"

### Composition control
Vague prompts like "put him on a beach" can change framing and camera angle.
Prefer:
"Change the background to a sunny beach while keeping the person in the exact same position, scale, pose, camera angle, framing and perspective. Only replace the environment around them."

### Style not applying correctly
Use richer style descriptions:
"Convert to pencil sketch with natural graphite lines, cross-hatching, and subtle paper texture"

## Safety & Content Guidelines
- Avoid requesting generation of disallowed content (follow your platform's content policy)
- Obfuscate or avoid personal identifying edits if you do not have consent

## Best Practices Summary
- Be specific: use exact descriptors for color, lighting, and materials
- Start simple: make incremental changes and iterate
- Preserve intentionally: call out what must not change
- Use quotes for text edits: "Replace 'X' with 'Y'"
- Control composition explicitly: specify camera angle, framing, and subject placement
- Choose verbs carefully: "transform" often implies full replacement; "change the clothes" is more focused

<Tip>
Making instructions explicit helps accuracy; keep edits limited to a few clear directives per prompt.
