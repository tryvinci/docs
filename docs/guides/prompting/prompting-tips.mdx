While these tips are broadly applicable, remember that specific services like [Text-to-Image](/docs/guides/prompting/text-to-image) and [Image-to-Image](/docs/guides/prompting/image-to-image) may have their own nuances and advanced techniques.

## Core Principles of Effective Prompting

Before diving into specific tips, it's essential to understand the foundational principles that govern all effective prompting.

### Clarity and Specificity

<Tip>
The most common reason for unsatisfactory AI outputs is ambiguity. The more precise and unambiguous your prompt, the more likely the AI will generate content that matches your vision.
</Tip>

**Why Specificity Matters:**
AI models interpret language based on patterns and associations. Vague terms can lead to unpredictable results, while specific descriptions provide clear guidance.

**From Vague to Specific:**
- **Vague:** "A dog"
- **Better:** "A golden retriever"
- **Best:** "A golden retriever sitting in a sunny meadow, looking directly at the camera with its tongue out"

### Structure and Organization

Well-organized prompts help the AI understand what elements are most important and how they relate to each other.

**Recommended Structure:**
1. **Subject** - What is the main focus?
2. **Action** - What is happening?
3. **Environment** - Where is this taking place?
4. **Style** - What visual style or aesthetic?
5. **Technical details** - Any specific requirements?

## Essential Prompting Techniques

### Use Descriptive Language

Replace generic terms with specific, descriptive language:

- Instead of "beautiful," use "elegant," "stunning," or "breathtaking"
- Instead of "big," use "massive," "towering," or "enormous"
- Instead of "colorful," specify actual colors like "vibrant purple and gold"

### Include Context and Setting

Provide environmental context to create more immersive and realistic outputs:

```
"A cozy coffee shop interior with warm lighting, exposed brick walls, 
vintage furniture, and steam rising from a cup of coffee on a wooden table"
```

### Specify Technical Parameters

When relevant, include technical details:

- **Lighting:** "soft natural lighting," "dramatic shadows," "golden hour"
- **Camera angle:** "wide shot," "close-up," "bird's eye view"
- **Style:** "photorealistic," "artistic," "minimalist"

## Common Prompting Mistakes

<Warning>
Avoid these common pitfalls that can negatively impact your results.
</Warning>

### Overcomplicating Prompts

While detail is important, overly complex prompts can confuse the AI. Find the right balance between specificity and clarity.

**Too Complex:**
```
"An extremely photorealistic image of a majestic golden retriever with flowing fur 
that catches the light beautifully while sitting gracefully in a perfectly manicured 
meadow filled with exactly seventeen different types of wildflowers..."
```

**Better:**
```
"A golden retriever sitting in a sunny wildflower meadow, 
photorealistic style, soft natural lighting"
```

### Contradictory Instructions

Avoid providing conflicting directions within the same prompt:

- Don't ask for both "minimalist" and "highly detailed"
- Don't request "vintage" and "futuristic" unless specifically for contrast

### Negative Language

Instead of describing what you don't want, focus on what you do want:

- **Avoid:** "Not blurry, not dark, not cluttered"
- **Better:** "Sharp focus, bright lighting, clean composition"

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Chaining

For complex scenes, break your prompt into logical components:

1. **Main subject:** "A professional chef"
2. **Action:** "preparing fresh pasta"
3. **Environment:** "in a modern restaurant kitchen"
4. **Mood:** "focused and passionate expression"
5. **Style:** "documentary photography style"

### Using References

When appropriate, reference well-known styles or artists (for non-copyrighted work):

- "In the style of classical portrait photography"
- "Minimalist architectural photography"
- "Vintage travel poster aesthetic"

### Iterative Refinement

Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Use an iterative approach:

1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Identify what needs improvement
3. Add specific details to address those areas
4. Test and refine further

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### For Image Generation

- Include aspect ratio preferences when relevant
- Specify image quality expectations
- Consider composition and framing

### For Video Generation

- Think about movement and transitions
- Consider duration and pacing
- Include audio considerations if applicable

## Testing and Optimization

### Keep a Prompt Journal

Document what works and what doesn't:
- Successful prompts and their results
- Failed attempts and lessons learned
- Variations that led to improvements

### A/B Testing

Try variations of the same concept:
- Different adjectives for the same subject
- Various lighting conditions
- Alternative composition styles

<Tip>
The key to mastering prompting is practice and experimentation. Start with these fundamentals and gradually develop your own style and techniques.
