By understanding the various prompting techniques and creative parameters, you can achieve precise control over your video outputs, from basic actions to complex camera movements and aesthetic styles.

## Platform Capabilities

Vinci's video generation platform supports both Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video creation, offering a complete range of creative possibilities:

- Basic to advanced camera movements and shot compositions
- Character interactions and environmental storytelling
- Focus control and depth of field effects
- Multi-shot sequences with sophisticated transitions
- Character transformations and metamorphosis effects

### Text-to-Video

Create videos directly from your written descriptions. This approach gives you complete creative freedom to build scenes and narratives through detailed prompts.

### Image-to-Video

Transform your static images into dynamic video sequences. Perfect for bringing existing visuals to life or adding motion to still content.

## Creative Controls

The following parameters give you precise control over your video creation process.

### Your Creative Prompt

This is where you describe exactly what you want to create. Use natural language to tell your story, describe actions, set the scene, and direct the camera.

#### Basic Actions

Describe the subject and their action.
**Examples:**
- `A man walking in a park.`
- `The man turns his head and smiles at the camera.`
- `A woman picks up the wine glass in front of her, takes a sip, puts it down.`

#### Multiple Action Commands

You can specify sequential actions for a single character or multiple characters.
**Examples:**
- `A man walks, then runs, then jumps.`
- `A dog barks, and a cat meows.`
- `The steady and indifferent boy looks at the camera and takes off his earphones. Then he jumps off the tire, walks toward the camera, and squats down.`

#### Character Interaction and Emotional Scenes

Create compelling character-driven narratives with emotional depth.
**Examples:**
- `The woman was crying and drinking, and a man came in to comfort her.`
- `Kittens and puppies eat cat food. **Shot Switch.** Close-up cat food is distinct.`

#### Camera Language

Control camera movements and perspectives with precision.

##### Basic Camera Movements

*   `push` / `the camera quickly pushes in`: Camera moves forward into the scene
*   `pull` / `the camera quickly pulls back`: Camera moves backward away from the scene
*   `pan` / `the camera pans right`: Camera rotates horizontally from a fixed position
*   `track` / `the camera tracks right`: Camera moves horizontally alongside the subject
*   `orbit` / `the camera orbits around`: Camera circles around the subject
*   `follow` / `the camera follows`: Camera moves behind the subject, maintaining distance
*   `rise` / `the camera gradually rises`: Camera moves vertically upwards
*   `descend` / `the camera tilts down`: Camera moves vertically downwards
*   `zoom` / `gradually zooms in from below`: Camera lens adjusts magnification

##### Advanced Camera Movements

Combine multiple movements for cinematic complexity.
**Examples:**
- `The camera focuses on the teacher in the background, the girl in the foreground becomes blurred.`
- `Camera moves to the left. The statue holds an ancient book in its hands.`
- `Lens surround 360 degree display` for orbital movement
- `Handheld lens` for realistic, shaky movement
- `cuts to an overhead shot` for perspective changes

#### Shot Size and Perspective Control

Define the framing and viewpoint of your video with professional terminology.

*   `long shot`: Shows the entire subject and its surroundings
*   `wide shot`: Similar to long shot, emphasizing the environment
*   `medium shot`: Frames the subject from the waist up
*   `close shot`: Frames the subject from the chest up
*   `close-up`: Focuses tightly on specific details, often the face
*   `underwater`: Shot from beneath the water surface
*   `aerial` / `overhead shot`: Shot from high above, often from drone or aircraft
*   `high-angle`: Camera looks down on the subject
*   `low-angle`: Camera looks up at the subject
*   `macro`: Extreme close-up, revealing fine details
*   `foreground shots`: Emphasize elements in the immediate foreground
*   `miniature photography`: Creates dollhouse-like scale effects

#### Multi-Style Direct Output

Specify artistic styles for your video.

*   `2D`: Flat, two-dimensional animation
*   `3D`: Three-dimensional rendering
*   `voxel`: Pixelated 3D style
*   `pixel`: Retro 8-bit or 16-bit style
*   `felt`: Appears as if made from felt fabric
*   `clay`: Appears as if made from claymation
*   `illustration`: Hand-drawn or digital illustration style
*   `Japanese manga`: Distinctive Japanese comic book style
*   `American comic`: Classic American comic book style
*   `fabric` / `stitched`: Textile and material-based aesthetics

#### Aesthetics Control

Refine the visual and emotional tone of your video.

*   **Character Appearance:** Describe specific features, clothing, or expressions
    - Example: `A close-up shot of a young man with messy short black hair eating chicken thighs at night. He looks a little embarrassed, his face is dirty, his eyes are swollen.`
*   **Visual Aesthetics:** Use terms like `cinematic`, `dreamlike`, `gritty`, `vibrant`, `monochromatic`
*   **Video Type:** Specify `documentary`, `music video`, `short film`, `advertisement`
*   **Emotion:** Convey feelings such as `joyful`, `melancholy`, `tense`, `peaceful`
*   **Atmosphere:** Set the mood with `eerie`, `cozy`, `bustling`, `serene`
    - Example: `blurred city night scene`, `bustling street`
*   **Lighting:** Control lighting conditions
    - `golden hour`, `moonlit`, `harsh`, `soft light hit the dial`
    - `yellow and blue lights`

#### Multi-Shot Capability and Transitions

Create videos with multiple distinct shots and professional transitions.

*   **Continuity:** Ensure smooth transitions between scenes
*   **Shot Transitions:** Use commands like:
    - `**Shot Switch.**` (Vinci format)
    - `cut to`, `fade to black`, `dissolve to`
    - `cuts to an overhead shot`
*   **New Characters/Scenes:** Introduce new elements after transitions
    **Examples:**
    - `A man walks down the street, cut to a woman sitting in a cafe.`
    - `Deep in the temple, a man with a backpack finds a statue. **Camera moves to the left.** The statue holds an ancient book.`

#### Advanced Effects and Transformations

Create sophisticated visual effects and character metamorphoses.

**Transformation Examples:**
- `The boy puts down his book, unbuttons his clothes to reveal a Spider-Man suit, puts on the Spider-Man mask, shoots webbing out of the frame.`
- `The boy is reading a book, and as he reads, he grows old. The cheeks are sagging more and more, the skin pores are becoming increasingly visible.`

**Time-Based Effects:**
- `The hands of the watch rotate at a constant speed. **Shot Switch.** The man raised his hand to hold his gold glasses.`
- `The frame gradually turns into a black and white style with obvious graininess.`

#### Focus and Depth of Field Control

Control visual focus and depth perception.

*   **Focus Shifts:** `The camera focuses on the teacher in the background, the girl in the foreground becomes blurred`
*   **Lens Focus:** Technical focus control for cinematic depth
*   **Close-up Details:** `Close-up cat food is distinct`

#### Aspect Ratio Support

Specify the desired aspect ratio for your video.

*   `1:1` (Square)
*   `3:4` (Portrait)
*   `4:3` (Standard Definition)
*   `16:9` (Widescreen)
*   `9:16` (Vertical/Mobile)
*   `21:9` (Cinematic Widescreen)

#### Adverbs of Degree and Movement Quality

Adjust the intensity and style of actions.

*   `slowly`, `quickly`, `rapidly`, `gently`, `forcefully`
*   `at a constant speed`, `gradually`
*   `steady and indifferent`, `very angrily`

#### Addressing Common Issues

*   **Limb Collapse:** For complex character movements, ensure clear descriptions to prevent unnatural limb positioning
*   **Clear Instructions:** Be specific and concise to ensure Vinci accurately interprets your creative vision
*   **Character Consistency:** Use detailed physical descriptions to maintain character appearance throughout transformations

## Creative Examples

### Character Interaction

**Focus and Emotion:**
```text
The camera focuses on the teacher in the background, the girl in the foreground becomes blurred, and the teacher curses very angrily.
```

**Environmental Discovery:**
```text
Deep in the temple, a man with a backpack finds a statue of an ancient wise man. **Camera moves to the left.** The statue holds an ancient book in its hands, seemingly guarding some important knowledge.
```

### Detailed Character Work

**Rich Character Description:**
```text
A close-up shot of a young man with messy short black hair eating chicken thighs at night. He looks a little embarrassed, his face is dirty, his eyes are swollen, his jaws are round, there are a few black moles on his nose, a little beard, his teeth are a little yellow, his eyes are looking to the left of the picture, a little distracted, wearing a blue-gray tattered trench coat, and his cuffs and clothes are stained with a lot of dirt.
```

### Advanced Transformations

**Character Transformation:**
```text
The boy puts down his book, unbuttons his clothes to reveal a Spider-Man suit, puts on the Spider-Man mask, shoots webbing out of the frame, and quickly flies upward out of the frame towards the camera.
```

**Time-Based Effects:**
```text
The boy is reading a book, and as he reads, he grows old. The cheeks are sagging more and more, the skin pores are becoming increasingly visible, sideburns and a beard have grown, turning into a weathered uncle. The frame also gradually turns into a black and white style with obvious graininess.
```

**Complex Movement Sequence:**
```text
The steady and indifferent boy looks at the camera and takes off his earphones. Then he jumps off the tire, walks toward the camera, and squats down.
```

## Advanced Prompting Strategies

### Template Structure

Follow this structured approach for optimal results:
```text
[SUBJECT DESCRIPTION] + [ACTION/MOVEMENT] + [CAMERA INSTRUCTION] + [SCENE/ENVIRONMENT] + [STYLE/AESTHETIC]
```

### Multi-Shot Sequences

For complex narratives, use shot switches:
```text
[SCENE 1 DESCRIPTION]. **Shot Switch.** [SCENE 2 DESCRIPTION].
```

### Professional Camera Work

Combine multiple camera techniques:
```text
The camera quickly pushes in, then tracks right, and gradually rises to reveal the full scene.
```
