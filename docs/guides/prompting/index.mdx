## What is Prompting?

Prompting is the art of communicating with AI models through carefully crafted text instructions. The quality of your prompts directly impacts the quality, consistency, and relevance of generated content.

  <Tab title="Why Prompting Matters">
    <Info>
      Effective prompting is the difference between generic results and content that precisely matches your vision. Well-crafted prompts help AI models understand your intent, style preferences, and technical requirements.
    </Info>
    
    **Key Benefits:**
    - **Higher Quality Outputs**: Clear, specific prompts produce more accurate and visually appealing results
    - **Consistent Style**: Maintain visual consistency across multiple generations
    - **Faster Iteration**: Reduce trial-and-error by getting closer to your desired result on the first try
    - **Cost Efficiency**: Better prompts mean fewer regeneration attempts, optimizing your API usage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Core Principles">
    <Tip>
      All effective prompts share these fundamental principles, regardless of the specific Vinci service you're using.
    </Tip>
    
    **Essential Prompting Principles:**
    - **Be Specific**: Use detailed descriptions rather than vague concepts
    - **Include Technical Details**: Specify lighting, camera angles, materials, and styles
    - **Structure Your Prompt**: Organize information logically (subject → attributes → environment → style)
    - **Use Negative Prompts**: Explicitly state what you don't want to see
    - **Iterate Incrementally**: Start simple and add complexity gradually

    <Steps>
      ### Step 1: Understand Your Goal
      Define what you want to create before writing your prompt. Consider the subject, style, mood, and technical requirements.
      
      ### Step 2: Start with Basic Prompts
      Begin with simple, clear descriptions to establish a foundation. Focus on the main subject and key attributes.
      
      ### Step 3: Refine and Enhance
      Gradually add details about lighting, composition, style, and technical specifications based on your results.
      
      ### Step 4: Use Advanced Techniques
      Apply negative prompts, style references, and iterative editing to achieve professional-quality results.
