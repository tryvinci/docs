# Text-to-Image Prompting Guide

<Tip>
Maximum prompt length: 512 tokens. Shorter prompts are easier to iterate.
</Tip>

## Overview
This guide consolidates best practices for text-to-image generation, drawing on FLUX Kontext, Vertex AI, and Runway recommendations. It focuses on prompt structure, photographic cues, style control, negative prompts, and iterative workflows.

<Info>
For fundamental prompting principles that apply to all Vinci services, see the [Prompting Tips](/docs/guides/prompting/prompting-tips) guide.

## Prompt structure
A reliable prompt usually includes these components in order:
- Subject: the main focus or character ("a golden retriever")
- Attributes: colors, materials, clothing, emotions ("wet fur, joyful expression")
- Environment: location, time, weather ("on a rocky beach at sunset")
- Perspective: camera angle or viewpoint ("eye-level, 85mm portrait lens")
- Style: art movement, artist references, or descriptive style ("hyperrealistic, cinematic")
- Lighting: direction, intensity, color ("soft rim light, golden hour")
- Quality modifiers: "ultra-detailed", "photorealistic", "8k"
- Negative prompts: explicit exclusions ("no text, no watermark, no extra limbs")

Example:
"A close-up portrait of an elderly woman with freckled skin, soft rim lighting, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field, photorealistic, Fujifilm Pro 400H color palette. No watermark, no text."

## Camera, lens, and photography cues
Including photographic details helps achieve realism:
- Lens: "50mm", "85mm", "wide-angle 24mm"
- Aperture: "f/1.8 shallow depth of field", "f/8 for landscape sharpness"
- Film or sensor: "Kodak Portra 400", "Fujifilm Pro 400H"
- Camera: "shot on a Hasselblad", "DSLR"
- Post-processing: "subtle film grain", "soft film emulation"

## Composition and framing
Be explicit about subject placement and aspect ratio:
- "Rule of thirds", "centered subject", "full body", "head and shoulders"
- Specify aspect ratio: "16:9", "1:1", "9:16" for vertical
- Indicate distance and scale: "close-up", "wide shot"

Prompt example:
"Wide-angle cinematic landscape, subject centered, 16:9, dramatic sky, leading lines to the horizon."

## Style and references
- Name movements ("Impressionist", "Bauhaus"), genres ("cyberpunk", "film noir"), or use descriptive adjectives ("glossy, hyperreal, painterly")
- Reference artists for inspiration, but when necessary prefer descriptive attributes to avoid policy issues
- Combine style + medium: "watercolor with visible paper texture", "digital 3D render, octane, cinematic lighting"

Example:
"In the style of Hayao Miyazaki, warm pastel palette, hand-painted textures, whimsical composition."

## Colors, materials, and lighting
- Use precise color names: "deep cherry red", "muted teal", "sunset orange"
- Describe materials and finishes: "matte ceramic", "polished metal"
- Lighting: "golden hour backlight", "softbox frontal lighting", "dramatic rim light"

## Controlling complexity & iterations
- Start with a concise core prompt to validate composition and subject
- Iterate by adding attributes, then styles, then high-quality modifiers
- Use seeds or "variations" options to get reproducible results
- For large changes, break into multiple prompts and combine outputs

## Negative prompts and safety
- Negative prompts prevent unwanted artifacts: "no text, no watermark, no extra limbs, no logos"
- Use them to reduce style bleed or accidental inclusion of objects
- Respect platform policies; avoid generating disallowed or private personal content

## Advanced modifiers and tokens
- Quality tokens: "ultra-detailed", "highly detailed", "8k"
- Lighting tokens: "cinematic lighting", "dramatic rim lighting"
- Avoid contradictory modifiers (e.g., "low-detail" and "ultra-detailed" together)
- Keep token budget in mind; longer complex prompts may be truncated

## Prompt examples

Prompt:
"A futuristic neon alley, wet pavement, cyberpunk city, dramatic rim lighting, long exposure, 35mm lens, ultra-detailed, photorealistic. No watermark, no text."
[Placeholder image: Prompt -> neon alley output]

Prompt:
"A whimsical watercolor painting of woodland animals having tea, soft pastel colors, visible paper texture, delicate brushstrokes, warm ambient light."
[Placeholder image: Prompt -> watercolor animals output]

Prompt:
"Product shot of a matte black wireless headphone on a minimal white pedestal, softbox lighting, 45-degree angle, high detail, studio photography style."

## Iterative refinement workflow
1. Generate a base image with a simple prompt.
2. Note issues or desired changes.
3. Add one or two modifiers (lighting, camera, color).
4. Use negatives to remove artifacts.
5. Re-run high-resolution render when satisfied.

## Troubleshooting common issues
- Blurry faces: add "sharp focus, high detail on face, high resolution"
- Extra fingers/limbs: add "natural anatomy, correct number of fingers, single person"
- Watermarks or logos: add "no watermark, no logo"
- Incorrect colors: specify "exact color name" and "color palette reference"

## Attribution and artist references
- Prefer descriptive style language when direct artist copying is restricted.
- Use "inspired by" or descriptive attributes: "vibrant brushwork, high-contrast chiaroscuro" instead of naming living artists when policy disallows.

## Performance and cost tips
- Use smaller images for rapid iteration (e.g., 512px)
- Reserve high-resolution runs (2k/4k) for final outputs
- Limit number of high-quality tokens during early experiments

## Example prompt bank
- Photo-realistic portraits
- Environmental concept art
- Product mockups and advertising shots
- Stylized character concepts

## Best Practices Summary
- Be explicit about the subject and priorities
- Iterate: start simple, refine incrementally
- Use negative prompts to exclude undesired elements
- Control composition and perspective explicitly
- Use photographic cues for realism when needed

<Tip>
Short iterative cycles with focused changes yield the most reliable results.
