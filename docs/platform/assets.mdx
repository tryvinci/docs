Assets are the AI-generated outputs you create on Vinci. Every successful generation automatically becomes an asset and is organized for easy retrieval.

## Types of assets
- Videos — AI-generated videos, animations, lip-sync content, translations
- Images — generated images, character portraits, transformed photos
- Audio — cloned voices, TTS files, translated audio

## Manage your assets
- Organization — grouped by type with timestamps and metadata
- Search & Filter — find assets by type or keywords
- Views — switch between grid and list
- Actions — preview, download, share (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp), or delete

## Asset details
Each asset includes creation date, file type, and descriptive titles generated automatically.

Tip
Use consistent naming and tags in your prompts to make searching easier later.
